# THE FILTER with Sexball Clearance
This mod is a modification of [THE FILTER](https://github.com/nateb16/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/nateb16/THE_FILTER) by nateb16.

I edited the side blower to fit symmetrically with the rest of THE FILTER setup under the bed. 

For the right side version, you can mirror the STLs in your slicer.

I did not have quick disconnect connectors available so everything was wired into Wago with some wire slack for carbon swapping. For secure magnetic mounting, it takes 6 3x6mm magnets.

Parts Needed:

* 5015 Fan, I used GDSTime Dual Ball
* 6 3x6mm magnets (For Magmount and body, You can get away with 4)
* 2 Roll-in M3 Nuts (For Magmount)
* 2 M3x12 Screw, any head (For Magmount)
* 2 M3x4x5 Heat-set insert or M3 Nuts (For Fan)
* 2 M3 BHCS Screw of good enough length (For Fan)

Assembly: 

* Insert Heatset insert into the bottom of the 5015 Fan (Or skip and use M3 Nuts)
* Carefully unclip the top plastic portion of the 5015 Fan
* Insert Fan into Body.STL and screw in with M3 BHCS
* Insert Magnets into the mount and body.stl
* Add carbon and slide in the cover
* Screw in the magmount to the bed 2020 extrusion
* Wire as needed and you're done! 


Print settings: Voron Standard with no supports.

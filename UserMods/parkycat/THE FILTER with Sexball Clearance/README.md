# THE FILTER with Sexball Clearance
This mod is a modification of [THE FILTER](https://github.com/nateb16/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/nateb16/THE_FILTER) by nateb16.

I edited the side blower to fit symmetrically with the rest of THE FILTER setup under the bed. 

For the right side version, you can mirror the STLs in your slicer.

I did not have quick disconnect connectors available so everything was wired into Wago with some wire slack for carbon swapping. For secure magnetic mounting, it takes 6 3x6mm magnets.

Parts Needed:

* 6 3x6mm magnets (You can get away with 4)
* 2 Roll-in M3 Nuts
* 2 M3x12 Screw, any head

Print settings: Voron Standard with no supports.
